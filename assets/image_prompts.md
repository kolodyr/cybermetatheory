Surrounding nodes: a blue record (music), white snowflakes, pink flowers, a brown paper scroll, silver clinic building, all connected by Van Gogh's signature swirling brushwork.

Islands connected by glowing data bridges in pink, purple, cyan. Tiny chibi figure (Flu) flies between them on butterfly wings. Retro video game aesthetic meets Monument Valley. 16-bit color palette with modern glow effects.
